=> 🔑 Key Concept of final and const keyword:
  final makes the variable immutable, not the object it points to.
  The reference to the list cannot change, but the content of the list can.

  📦 Explanation:
  final list1 = [1, 2, 3];  // The reference to the list is fixed.
  list1.add(4);             // ✅ Allowed: Modifying the content of the list.
  list1 = [5, 6, 7];        // ❌ Error: Cannot assign a new list to list1.
  list1 always points to the same list object.

  You can modify the list (add, remove, change items), but you cannot make list1 point to a new list.
  🪨 With const: Completely Immutable
  If you use const, even the content can't change:

  const list2 = [1, 2, 3];
  list2.add(4);  // ❌ Error: Cannot modify a const list.
  list2 is frozen—neither its reference nor its content can be changed.
  
  📝 Simple Analogy
  final → Whiteboard: You can't replace the whiteboard itself, but you can write or erase on it.
  const → Stone Tablet: You can't replace it, and you can't change what's written on it.
  
  ✅ Summary
  final: The reference can't change, but the object's content can.
  const: Both the reference and the content are completely immutable.
