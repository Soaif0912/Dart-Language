// Any class that implements the interface must define all methods and properties declared in the interface.

//  Interface
// Dart doesnâ€™t have a separate interface keyword. Instead, every class in Dart can act as an interface. To use a class as an interface, you implement it using the implements keyword.

// Key Points:
// When you implement a class, you must override all its methods (even if they have a body in the original class).
// Useful for defining strict contracts that classes must follow.
// You can implement multiple interfaces, supporting multiple inheritance.
